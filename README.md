# hello-world
I was born and raised in Charleston and I have lived here my entire life. I am a computer engineering major and I am a senior at the Citadel, with the rank of battalion human affairs officer. I am very interested in sports, specifically basketball and football. After I graduate, I would like to become a database admin.
